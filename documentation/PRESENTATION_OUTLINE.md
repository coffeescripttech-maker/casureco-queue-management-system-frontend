**What to say:**
> "Thank you for your time and attention. I'm happy to answer any questions you have about the system, implementation, pricing, or anything else."

## 💬 COMMON QUESTIONS & ANSWERS

### Q1: "What if the internet goes down?"

**Answer:**
> "Great question. The system requires internet to sync data across devices. However, the UPS provides 15-30 minutes of backup power during outages. For internet issues, staff can still serve customers manually, and the system will sync when connection is restored. We recommend having a backup internet connection (like mobile hotspot) for critical operations."

---

### Q2: "How difficult is it to use?"

**Answer:**
> "It's extremely simple. For customers, it's just touching a screen - like using an ATM. For staff, it's one button: 'Call Next'. We've designed it to be intuitive. During our 2-day training, your staff will become completely comfortable with all features. Most users are confident within the first hour."

---

### Q3: "What if we need to add more counters later?"

**Answer:**
> "The system is fully scalable. Adding counters is easy - just add a laptop/computer and configure it in the admin panel. No additional software licenses needed for the first year. The system supports unlimited counters and multiple branches, so you can grow without limitations."

---

### Q4: "Can we customize the ticket design?"

**Answer:**
> "Absolutely! We'll customize tickets with your logo, colors, and branding during setup. You can also change the header and footer text, add custom messages, and adjust the layout. If you sign by December 31st, custom ticket design is included free in our special offer."

---

### Q5: "What happens after the 3-month support period?"

**Answer:**
> "After 3 months, you have several options. You can continue without paid support - the system will keep working. You can purchase support as needed per incident. Or you can subscribe to our monthly (₱5,000) or annual (₱50,000) support plan for ongoing assistance, priority support, and on-site visits. Most clients choose the annual plan for peace of mind."

---

### Q6: "How secure is the customer data?"

**Answer:**
> "Security is a top priority. All data is encrypted in transit and at rest. The database is hosted on Supabase, a enterprise-grade cloud platform with SOC 2 compliance. We implement role-based access control, so staff only see what they need. Regular backups are automatic. The system follows data privacy best practices."

---

### Q7: "Can we use our existing printers?"

**Answer:**
> "The system is designed for thermal printers for best results - they're fast, silent, and don't require ink. However, if you have existing printers, we can evaluate compatibility. Thermal printers are included in the package because they provide the best customer experience with instant, professional tickets."

---

### Q8: "What if a staff member forgets their password?"

**Answer:**
> "No problem. Supervisors and admins can reset passwords instantly from the admin panel. We also provide a 'Forgot Password' feature for self-service reset via email. During training, we'll show you how to manage user accounts, including password resets."

---

### Q9: "Can we see reports from previous months?"

**Answer:**
> "Yes! The system stores all historical data. You can generate reports for any date range - yesterday, last week, last month, or custom ranges. Reports can be viewed on-screen or exported to CSV/PDF for further analysis. This helps you track trends and make data-driven decisions."

---

### Q10: "What if we want to cancel?"

**Answer:**
> "We're confident you'll love the system, but we understand business decisions. If you cancel before installation, there's a 20% cancellation fee to cover preparation costs. After installation, the contract is fulfilled and there's no refund. However, we offer a satisfaction guarantee - if you're not happy during installation, we'll work with you to make it right."
