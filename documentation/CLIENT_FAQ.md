## 🌟 GENERAL QUESTIONS

### Q1: What is a Queue Management System?
**A:** A Queue Management System (QMS) is a digital solution that manages customer flow and waiting lines. Instead of physical queues, customers take numbered tickets from a kiosk, and staff call them when ready to serve. The system displays queue information on a TV screen and announces ticket numbers through speakers.

### Q2: Why do we need a Queue Management System?
**A:** Benefits include:
- **Reduced perceived wait time** - Customers can sit comfortably instead of standing in line
- **Improved customer satisfaction** - Fair, organized service
- **Better staff efficiency** - No confusion about who's next
- **Data and analytics** - Track performance, wait times, and service quality
- **Professional image** - Modern, organized appearance
- **Social distancing** - Especially important for health and safety

### Q3: How long does the entire implementation take?
**A:** **Only 4 days from start to go-live!**
- Day 1: Hardware installation
- Day 2: Software configuration
- Day 3: Basic training
- Day 4: Advanced training and GO LIVE

### Q4: Will our operations be disrupted during installation?
**A:** Minimal disruption. We recommend scheduling installation during off-peak hours or weekends if possible. The system can be installed while you continue normal operations, and we'll switch over when everything is ready.

### Q5: What if we don't like the system after installation?
**A:** We have a comprehensive acceptance criteria process. The system must meet all agreed specifications before final payment. If issues arise, we'll address them within 5 business days at no additional cost. See our General Terms & Conditions for details.

### Q6: Can the system grow with our business?
**A:** Yes! The system is scalable and supports:
- Multiple branches
