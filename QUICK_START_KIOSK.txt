QUICK START: AUTOMATIC PRINTING KIOSK
========================================

SETUP (One-time only):
======================

1. Set Gprinter GP-1424D as DEFAULT printer
   - Windows Settings → Printers → Gprinter GP-1424D
   - Click "Manage" → "Set as default"

2. Make sure dev server is running
   - Open terminal in project folder
   - Run: npm run dev
   - Wait for "Ready on http://localhost:3000"


LAUNCH KIOSK MODE:
==================

Double-click: launch-kiosk.bat

This will:
✅ Close all Chrome windows
✅ Launch in full-screen kiosk mode
✅ Enable AUTOMATIC printing (no dialog!)
✅ Print directly to Gprinter GP-1424D


HOW IT WORKS:
=============

1. User selects service
2. User selects priority
3. Ticket appears on screen
4. After 0.8 seconds → AUTOMATICALLY PRINTS!
5. Beautiful design with logo, colors, borders
6. No print dialog - goes straight to printer!
7. Page resets after 15 seconds


BENEFITS OF KIOSK MODE:
=======================

✅ Full-screen (no browser UI)
✅ Automatic printing (no user action needed)
✅ Beautiful ticket design preserved
✅ Logo, colors, borders all print correctly
✅ Professional kiosk experience


TO EXIT KIOSK MODE:
===================

Press: Alt + F4
Or: Ctrl + W


TROUBLESHOOTING:
================

Problem: Print dialog still appears
Solution: Make sure you launched via launch-kiosk.bat
         (Not just opening Chrome normally)

Problem: Printer not found
Solution: Verify Gprinter GP-1424D is set as DEFAULT

Problem: Blank page
Solution: Make sure npm run dev is running first


NORMAL MODE vs KIOSK MODE:
===========================

NORMAL MODE (npm run dev + open browser):
- Shows print dialog
- User clicks Print button
- Good for testing

KIOSK MODE (launch-kiosk.bat):
- NO print dialog
- Automatic printing
- Full-screen
- Production-ready


For production deployment, always use KIOSK MODE!
