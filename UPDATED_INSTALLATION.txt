========================================
UPDATED: THERMAL PRINTER SETUP (NO EXTRA PACKAGES NEEDED!)
========================================

GOOD NEWS: I've updated the code to use Windows built-in printing!
No need to install @thiagoelg/node-printer anymore.

STEP 1: Remove the problematic package (if you installed it)
-------------------------------------------------------------
npm uninstall @thiagoelg/node-printer


STEP 2: Set Gprinter as Default Printer
----------------------------------------
1. Press Windows Key
2. Type "Printers & scanners" and open it
3. Find "Gprinter GP-1424D"
4. Click on it → Click "Manage"
5. Click "Set as default"


STEP 3: Restart Your Server
----------------------------
npm run dev


STEP 4: Test It!
----------------
1. Go to: http://localhost:3000/kiosk
2. Select a service
3. Select priority level
4. Ticket will print automatically to Gprinter GP-1424D!


HOW IT WORKS NOW:
=================

✅ Uses Windows PowerShell commands (built-in, no packages needed!)
✅ Creates temporary text file with ticket data
✅ Sends to printer using Windows Out-Printer command
✅ Auto-deletes temp file after printing
✅ Works with any Windows printer, including thermal printers


WHAT CHANGED:
=============

- Removed dependency on @thiagoelg/node-printer
- Now uses native Windows printing via PowerShell
- More reliable and compatible with Next.js
- No native modules or compilation issues


FILES UPDATED:
==============

1. app/api/print-ticket/route.ts - Now uses PowerShell printing
2. app/api/printer-status/route.ts - Checks printer via PowerShell


TROUBLESHOOTING:
================

If printing doesn't work:

1. Make sure Gprinter GP-1424D is set as DEFAULT printer
2. Check printer is ON and connected
3. Test printer with Notepad first (File → Print)
4. Check terminal for error messages
5. Visit http://localhost:3000/api/printer-status


PRINTER NAME:
=============

The code looks for printers named:
- "Gprinter GP-1424D"
- Or any printer with "Gprinter" in the name

If your printer has a different name:
1. Open Control Panel → Devices and Printers
2. Note the EXACT printer name
3. Update line 157 in app/api/print-ticket/route.ts:
   const printerName = 'YOUR_EXACT_PRINTER_NAME';


That's it! No packages to install, just use Windows built-in printing!
